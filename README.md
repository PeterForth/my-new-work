DEC PDP-8  simulator 

All written in Win32forth , including the DEC assembler.

Since Forth is an interpretative language, you can compile
test and run, on the PDP-8 simulator also on the Win32forth
console simple type in your commands !

And of course also interact with the mouse over the DEC panel buttons, 
all switches work like the real machine. Have a look that there are
some pre configured switches in order to  start more easily some demonstrations.
For example > there is a random leds, a program counter demo, etc.
See on the menu, the description of  switch1,2,to 8.
