DEC PDP-8  simulator 

All written in Win32forth , including the DEC assembler.

Since Forth is an interpretative language, you can compile
test and run, on the PDP-8 simulator also on the Win32forth
console.
And also interact with the mouse on the DEC panel buttons, and
look I have pre configured some of them to start some demonstrations.
There is a random leds, a program counter demo, etc.
See the menu, the description of  switch1, 2, to 8.

See the video :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfbrnJBScP4&t=28s
If you like Forth, you can get more information on books and videos, on my web-site 
with examples, etc all arround Win32forth
